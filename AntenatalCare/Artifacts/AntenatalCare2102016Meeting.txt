Use Case
The simple use case is a new patient/client comes into the center requiring antenatal care
1) CHO opens Consulting Register and records preliminary information.	
2) Once complete the CHO opens the Antenatal Care Register.
3) Items up through and including Age are pulled and populated from the Consulting Register.
(Need to figure out how to make this happen)
4) CHO conducts exam and records data points above. (We will need to figure out how to save
progress in case power is lost).
5) CHO submits information.
6) System alerts CHO if items are missing.
7) CHO adds the missing information.
8) System alerts CHO that the register is complete and saved to storage.
