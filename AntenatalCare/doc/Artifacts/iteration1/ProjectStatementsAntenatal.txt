

Project Statement: Antenatal Care data collection and reporting is part of a semester 
long project to develop an application to maintain health service delivery information 
by community health nurses or officers (CHOs) in rural Ghanaian health clinics.

Problem Statement: Develop a subsection of an application to record, store, retrieve, 
update and possibly delete information obtained during antenatal visits to a rural 
health clinic, as well as to produce a monthly Midwifes Report. 

Things to Keep in Mind
* This subsection is only a part of a larger application
* The Person object will be used across subsections of the application
* User interface is important to the customer

Identified Risks
* UI design could prove challenging.
* Shared Person data structure.
* Will need to interact with other sections of the application.
