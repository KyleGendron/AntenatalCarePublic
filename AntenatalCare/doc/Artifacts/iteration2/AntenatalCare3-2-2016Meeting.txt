Antenatal Meeting 3/2/2016

AntenatalVisit object changes:
-Will be renamed pregnancy for the sake of brevity.

-At its core, the AntenatalVisit object is actually meant to represent both the first visit of a pregnancy
 and also hold all the optional fields that can be updated at any time.  Since this object expires with 
 the end of the pregnancy and will have all subsequent visits relevant to this pregnancy associated with it, 
 we will rename this class pregnancy. (minor refactor)
 
-In case the pregnancy is terminated at any point before the Births and Deliveries Department can handle it, 
we need a Boolean to deactivate the current pregnancy object in our system.  Termination may need to be 
reported to Births and Deliveries department for the sake of their report (future iteration issue).

-Change all yes/no boolean values to simple check boxes to save space. (Refactor)


Subvisit Type Changes:

-Object that will be separate from the pregnancy instance, but associated with via foreign key (GUID).

Subvisit GUI Additions:

-Will be listed in separate tabs next to the first visit/general pregnancy info tab, sorted most recent on the far right.  
Each new subsequent visit will be created by clicking a right-most blank tab titled “New Subsequent Visit.”  

Overall GUI changes:
-Considered but reject idea of auto-populating all previous pregnancies as individual tabs below the Consulting 
Register panel on screen once a patient account had been selected and the Antenatal Tab selected.  Page will remain
blank until either “Create New Antenatal Visit” (or rather, pregnancy) or Find Previous Visits is selected.

-When Find Previous Visits is selected, the same form as with entering a new pregnancy will appear, with the fields that
have already been entered populated with values pulled from the database.  Again, this will be the primary form referred 
to for any given pregnancy.  

-When a previous pregnancy is found, fields should be available for modification if the pregnancy is still active.  Also, 
subsequent visits should be able to be added if the pregnancy is still active.
