Iteration 2 Plan:

Use Cases:
* CHO conducts a follow-up exam and records new information into the register.

1. CHO opens Consulting Register, enters patient search information and finds account.
2. Once found, the CHO opens the Antenatal Care Register.
3. Consulting Register panel above Antenatal panel populated with data.
4. CHO conducts exam and fill out New Subsequent Visit information.
5. System alerts CHO if any fields are missing.
6. CHO adds missing information if necessary.
7. System alerts the CHO that the Subsequent Visit is complete and saved to storage.
8. CHO views complete Antenatal Care form and reviews information and looks for any optional fields not filled out.
9. CHO screens patient and fills out any new fields discovered to be valid (for example, Venereal Disease Lab Results, 
    once the patient has had the test after the initial antenatal visit).
10. Once all applicable fields are filled out, CHO submits info.
11. System alerts the CHO that the Antenatal Visit form has been updated.

* CHO searches for past antenatal exams of a patient.

1. CHO opens Consulting Register, enters patient search information and finds account.
2. Once found, the CHO opens the Antenatal Care Register.
3. Consulting Register panel above Antenatal panel populated with data.
4. (there are a number of ways we could go about displaying previous antenatal care objects, we need to flesh this out)

Tasks:
* Ensure Input Validation
      - Ensure input types are valid
      - Ensure that any input field that is dependent on another field is inactive unless the other field is satisfied.
        (for example, make sure that if Sickling Status isn't filled out, Sickling Type is inactive).
      - Produce Error message popups to inform user of invalid entries (preferably done in one window, listing each
        invalid entry message on its own line)
* Expand program to include interface for searching for an existing patient's Antenatal Care information
      - Expand GUI to include interface for search.
      - Connect new GUI interface to controller for database search.
      - Pull data from database and populate fields on screen.
      - Allow for user to update currently-empty fields from this view.
* Expand AntenatalVisit View to include option for adding subsequent visit exam.
      - Create AntenatalSubsequentVisit object.
      - Add data structure of AntenatalSubsequentVisit objects to AntenatalVisit object.
      - Build window with Subsequent Visit fields in GUI.
      - Collect and store information from Subsequent Visit window.
* Dummy Person Object
      - Implement use of actual DummyPerson objects when searching for AntenatalVisit objects.
* Documentation
      - Create basic JDoc comments
