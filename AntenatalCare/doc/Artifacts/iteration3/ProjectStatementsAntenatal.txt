

Project Statement: Antenatal Care data collection and reporting is part of a semester
long project to develop an application to maintain health service delivery information
by community health nurses or officers (CHOs) in rural Ghanaian health clinics.

Problem Statement: Develop a subsection of an application to record, store, retrieve,
update and possibly delete information obtained during antenatal visits to a rural
health clinic, as well as to produce a monthly Midwifes Report.

* The Person object will be used across subsections of the application
* User interface is important to the customer

Identified Risks
